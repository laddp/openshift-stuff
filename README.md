# openshift-stuff
Some openshift hacking bits

* pidstat_by_namespace: summarize CPU use by namespace from pidstat output
* sleepy_pod: Pod that sleeps for some time
* sleepy_dc: Deployment config that fails readiness checks on sleepy_pod  
* test_echo_pod: Pod that echos a ton of stuff to stdout - useful for stress testing logging
